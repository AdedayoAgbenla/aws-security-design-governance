<h1>Secure Development &amp; Governance Implementation</h1>
<h3>AWS Enterprise Environment</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This repository documents the implementation of secure development governance practices, including secure coding standards,
  architecture security reviews, risk exception management, and developer security training. The goal was to embed security
  into the software development lifecycle and reduce risks before deployment.

  <li>Created secure coding guidelines covering input validation, authentication, session management, and password protection</li>
  <li>Promoted OWASP Top 10 awareness to reduce common web application vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Conducted pre-deployment architecture security reviews to identify exposure and misconfiguration risks</li>
  <li>Recommended network isolation, IAM least privilege, and AWS WAF protection for public-facing systems</li>
  <li>Reviewed encryption and monitoring controls using AWS KMS, TLS, CloudTrail, and GuardDuty</li>
  <li>Performed formal security exception risk assessments and documented compensating controls</li>
  <li>Approved time-bound risk exceptions with enhanced monitoring requirements</li>
  <li>Designed and delivered security knowledge-sharing sessions for developers and architects</li>
  <li>Produced security reference guides, cheat sheets, and training materials</li>
</ul>
